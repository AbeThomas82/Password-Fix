# Password Randomizer

## Description

The website that we are retooling in this exercise is essentially a password generation web application replete with CSS and JS code used to create a random combination of alphanumeric characters set to an input amount specified by the end user.

The purpose of this assignment was to demonstrate the requisite CSS and JavaScript skills in coding in order to demonstrate syntax, flow, and application knowledge used in class and gained through resources in the fine-tuning of the site. Knowledge of DOM, methods, arrays, functions, variables, and loop structures were pertinent in the application of this exercise.

Prompts, alerts, and console logs were included to help the developer follow along in the execution of the assignment.

I have learned from this challenge there are a lot of intricate moving parts in the tabulation and creation of random characters in forming passwords. It was interesting to get a look at the inside of this tedious yet impressive process.

## Installation
Modified index.html and style.css files in VS Code and included requisite comments.

Added all modified and untracked files in the entire repository using git.

Finally pushed all finished work to GitHub.

GitPages supplied deployed changes to launch refactored website.

## Usage
The end user should be able to generate passwords formed from a combination of uppercase, lowercase, numerical, and special characters in forming the desired password for a website.
